{"biology": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about biology.\n\nQ: Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning arthropods?\n(A) They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan. (B) They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart. (C) They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources. (D) They lack paired, jointed appendages. (E) N/A (F) N/A (G) N/A (H) N/A (I) N/A (J) N/A\nA: Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?\n(A) 19/400 (B) 1/400 (C) 40/400 (D) 38/400 (E) 2/400 (F) 1/200 (G) 20/400 (H) 50/400 (I) N/A (J) N/A\nA: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. \u200bThe frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\\sqrt{\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?\n(A) By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum (B) By changing the enzyme's molecular weight (C) An amino acid change away from the active site increases the enzyme's substrate specificity. (D) By changing the shape of the protein (E) By changing the enzyme's temperature optimum (F) By altering the enzyme's ability to be denatured (G) By changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell (H) By changing the enzyme's color (I) An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity. (J) By altering the enzyme's rate of reaction\nA: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\n(A) Translation (B) Conjugation (C) Specialized transduction (D) Transformation (E) N/A (F) N/A (G) N/A (H) N/A (I) N/A (J) N/A\nA: Let's think step by step. The introduction of foreign DNA or RNA into bacteria or eukaryotic cells is a common technique in molecular biology and scientific research. There are multiple ways foreign DNA can be introduced into cells including transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transfection. In contrast, (A) is not a way to form DNA: during translation the ribosomes synthesize proteins from RNA.

The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = \nrac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.

An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (E).\n\nQ: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol.

Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $\nrac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \nrac{10^{-3.89} \\cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?\n(A) 0.250 mole (B) 0.500 mole (C) 3.00 mole (D) 1.00 mole (E) 3.50 mole (F) 1.50 mole (G) 2.50 mole (H) 4.00 mole (I) 0.750 mole (J) 2.00 mole\nA: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O \nightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles.

We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. The answer is (E).\n\nQ: A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\n(A) 3 + e^-2 (B) 2 - e^-4 (C) 2 - e^-2 (D) 3 + e^-4 (E) 2 + e^-3 (F) 2 - e^-3 (G) 3 - e^-2 (H) 2 + e^-2 (I) 2 + e^-4 (J) 2\nA: Let's think step by step. For all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.\nWe use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\\prime}$ and $s^{\\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \\Rightarrow\\left[s^{\\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n$$\n\frac{d}{d t}[\\ln (s-2)]=\frac{s^{\\prime}}{s-2}=\frac{-1}{25}=\frac{d}{d t}\\left[-\frac{t}{25}ight] .\n$$\nChoose $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \\cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. The answer is (I).\n\nQ: A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team.
