  - question: "Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?
      (A) 1000 times more (B) 50 times more (C) 5000 times more (D) 500 times more (E) 10000 times more (F) 20000 times more (G) 2000 times more (H) 100 times more (I) 10 times more (J) N/A"
    target: "Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \\pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5 mm and the telescope with diameter 50 cm is $(50 cm)^2/(5 mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (E)."
  - question: "Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?
      (A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud. (E) The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud. (F) The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud. (G) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt. (H) N/A (I) N/A (J) N/A"
    target: "Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A)."
  - question: "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is
      (A) 10 (B) 40 (C) 6 (D) 25 (E) 15 (F) 50 (G) 30 (H) 4 (I) 5 (J) 20"
    target: "Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (H)."
  - question: "Colors in a soap bubble result from light
      (A) dispersion (B) deflection (C) refraction (D) reflection (E) interference (F) converted to a different frequency (G) polarization (H) absorption (I) diffraction (J) transmission"
    target: "Let's think step by step. In a soap bubble film, the light bounces between the two soap-air interfaces many times, interfering with itself constructively or destructively depending on the width of the film. This results in different colors being visible. The answer is (E)."
  - question: "A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?
      (A) 240 W (B) 120 W (C) 10 W (D) 480 W (E) 360 W (F) 200 W (G) 30 W (H) 150 W (I) 60 W (J) 300 W"
    target: "Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (A)."
